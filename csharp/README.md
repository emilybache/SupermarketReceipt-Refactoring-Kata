# Code Smell Diagnosis Report

## Manual Review Findings
- **Issue 1**: Separate Dictionaries for Prices and Products (Original Code)
  - **Explanation**: Maintaining two separate dictionaries introduces redundancy and increases the risk of inconsistent data.
  - **Proposed Fix**: Combine into a single dictionary with product and price as a tuple.

- **Issue 2**: Lack of Error Handling for Missing Products
  - **Explanation**: The original code throws a `KeyNotFoundException` for missing product names.
  - **Proposed Fix**: Add validation to handle missing entries gracefully.

## Tool Analysis
- **SonarQube Results**:
  - No major issues identified. Tool confirmed improved readability and maintainability of refactored code.

## Recommendations
- Refactor methods in other classes to adhere to similar principles (e.g., null checks, error handling).
- Apply meaningful exception handling across the project to improve robustness.
