# Code Smell Diagnosis Report

## Manual Review Findings
### **Refactoring the `FakeCatalog` Class**

#### **Issue 1**: Separate Dictionaries for Prices and Products (Original Code)
  - **Explanation**: Maintaining two separate dictionaries introduces redundancy and increases the risk of inconsistent data.
  - **Proposed Fix**: Combine into a single dictionary with product and price as a tuple.

#### **Issue 2**: Lack of Error Handling for Missing Products
  - **Explanation**: The original code throws a `KeyNotFoundException` for missing product names.
  - **Proposed Fix**: Add validation to handle missing entries gracefully.

### **Refactoring the `Offer` Class**

#### **Issue 1**: Poor Encapsulation of `_product`
- **Explanation**: The `_product` field was private and not exposed as a property, making it less intuitive to access the product associated with an offer. This limited usability and violated encapsulation principles.
- **Proposed Fix**: Replaced the private `_product` field with a public read-only `Product` property, improving encapsulation and consistency in the class design.

#### **Issue 2**: Lack of Validation for Constructor Arguments
- **Explanation**: The constructor did not validate inputs for `Product` or `Argument`. This could lead to runtime errors, such as null references or negative discount values.
- **Proposed Fix**: Added validation to:
  - Ensure the `Product` argument is not null.
  - Enforce that the `Argument` is non-negative, preventing invalid states for offers.

## Tool Analysis
- **SonarQube Results**:
  - No major issues identified. Tool confirmed improved readability and maintainability of refactored code.

## Recommendations
- Refactor methods in other classes to adhere to similar principles (e.g., null checks, error handling).
- Apply meaningful exception handling across the project to improve robustness.
